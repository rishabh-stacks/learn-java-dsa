Welcome to my learning repository! 

This Repository contains the Codes and Solutions as I progress through a Rigorous Plan to Master Java Development and Data Structures & Algorithms.
The Goal is to Build a Rock-Solid Foundation in Computer Science Fundamentals before moving to Backend Development.

Java Architecture, Installation, & Debugging. 
Primitive Data Types, I/O, & Type Casting. 
Conditionals, Loops & Switch Statements. 
Functions / Methods (Scopes, Shadowing, VarArgs). 
Arrays and ArrayLists (Internal working). 
Linear Search. 
Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive). 

Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Cyclic). 
Strings & StringBuilder. 
Math for DSA (Bit Manipulation, Number Theory). 
Recursion (Subsets, Permutations, N-Queens, Maze Problems).
